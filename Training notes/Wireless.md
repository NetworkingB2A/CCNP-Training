# Wireless 

## Wireless Lan Design
### What are the different roaming types?
Intra-controller roaming
Inter-controller roaming
Layer two roaming
Layer three roaming
Anchor controller
Foreign controller

### Wireless deployment options
Ad Hoc Wireless lan
- Two wireless clients connecting directly to each other
- no need for an access point
- Not used very often  

Autonomous access point
- Standalone, independent devices
- Home or small office environments
- Controller-less deployment model
- Not commonly used in large enterprise networks
- You must manage each one individually  

Mesh Wireless Lan
- Wireless access points that connect to each other with Wireless
- no need for a wired connection for the access point to work
- Service will drop the more access points you add  

Lightweight access point 
- Requires central wireless LAN controller (WLC)
- Controller-based deployment model
- WLCs can be physical or virtual
- Controller communications changes to the aps
- Control and provisioning of wireless access points (CAPWAP)
