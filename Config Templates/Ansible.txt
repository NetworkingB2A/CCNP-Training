example of a ansible host connections

ansible_connection=ansible.netcommon.network_cli
ansible_user=cisco
ansible_password=cisco

I created a custom field in netbox so i can call the ansible.netcommon.network_cli
I created a custom field in netbox so i can call the user name and password of cisco cisco look at the netbox_inventory file

I created the host files under my ansible config file so i override the default of /ect/ansible/host
  I am using netbox as my source

I changed my gather facts in my config file to be off by default and only on when i want it to be.

I also changed my become settings in my config file as well
Become = True
Become_method = enable
Become_user = cisco

I created an environmental variables for my netbox token.
  I created it under my ~/.bashrc
  the part that thew me off, I was trying this in my inventory file
  token: env:NETBOX_TOKEN but it needs to be this token:env: NETBOX_TOKEN
