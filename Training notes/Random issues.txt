Here is a list of random issues i have faced.

My devices in gns3 were not able to save their config
two issues i found. 
- the VM HDD was full 
  - ended up having an issue with a snapshot i forgot to delete. because of this i could not increase my disk space.
    I deleted the snap shot and was able to increase the space
- the Virtual router directory was full of crash files. ended up deleteing the crash files.


I created an environmental variables for my netbox token.
  I created it under my ~/.bashrc
  the part that thew me off, I was trying this in my inventory file
  token: env:NETBOX_TOKEN but it needs to be this token:env: NETBOX_TOKEN
