# CCNP-Training

The goal here is to pass my CCNP

The Plan 
- Configure Netbox as a source of truth
- Use Ansible to configure my Lab whenever I can
- Use Netbox with Ansible for inventory files

The current tool set
- GNS3 that is tied to my home lab network
    this allows me to SSH directly into the lab devices from my PC
- Netbox
    This is my source of truth. Then I don't have to create or update and inventory files ( at least that is what I think)
- Ansible
    this will allow me to configure all me devices if i need to/want to

Training Material
- Offical Cert Guide
- INE videos
- White papers
